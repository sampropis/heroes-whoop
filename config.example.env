PORT=3000
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_here_change_this_in_production
NODE_ENV=development

# Session Cookie Security
# Set to 'true' only if serving over HTTPS (required for production deployments)
# Leave unset or set to 'false' for local development with http://localhost
# This prevents "OAuth state mismatch" errors when running locally
SECURE_COOKIES=false

# OAuth Scopes
# Available scopes: read:cycles, read:recovery, read:sleep, read:workout, read:profile, read:body_measurement, offline
# The 'offline' scope enables refresh tokens for long-term access
# Format: Can be space-separated OR comma-separated (both work automatically)
# Examples (all equivalent):
#   WHOOP_SCOPES=read:cycles read:recovery read:sleep read:workout read:profile read:body_measurement offline
#   WHOOP_SCOPES=read:cycles,read:recovery,read:sleep,read:workout,read:profile,read:body_measurement,offline
#   WHOOP_SCOPES=read:cycles, read:recovery, read:sleep, read:workout, read:profile, read:body_measurement, offline
